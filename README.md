## Docker

The Dockerfile is a file that is used as an input for Docker to build a virtual environment 
(the same as our PC) with all the software it needs and also all the "environmental" requirements.

The requirements the application needs arte stored in requirements.txt. This file is to import these requirements 
when our docker runs.

To create the Dockerfile image: `docker build -t squit-backend:1.0 .`
